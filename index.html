        Some philosophers have tried to argue that a proposition is a statement. I would resist that because I think a proposition is mental or abstract, while a statement is linguistic, and I don’t think the mental and linguistic realms are the same. However what is true is that propositions can be expressed or represented by linguistic statements with some degree of accuracy; and that a proposition certainly has much more to do with statements than it does questions or commands.
